# MeteorJS-Minstant
Final assignment for Coursera Web Application Development with JavaScript and MongoDB course
# About this App…
This App was written for the final assignment of the excellent Coursera Web Application Development with JavaScript and MongoDB course.
The app enables a simple form of messaging between a pair of users. Eight dummy users are created with user names 'user1' to 'user8'. They all have the password 'test123'.

# The Code
The code can be found on GitHub. It should work on Chrome and Firefox. On occasion both browsers fail to load the Flatly Bootstrap theme and the navbar is black instead of green. Refresh (F5) usually fixes this. Firefox sometimes fails to load images. Again, refresh usually fixes it.
